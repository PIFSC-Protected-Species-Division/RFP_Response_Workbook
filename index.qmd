## Common Commponets for a Response to a RFP

-   **Cover or Title Page:** Contains specific information about the proposal and the Institute and requires specific authorizations/signatures.

-   **Abstract or Project Summary:** Outlines the proposed research, including the objectives, methodology, and significance of the research.

-   **Statement of Work (SOW):** Provides a full and detailed explanation of the proposed research, and typically includes a project timetable. The SOW describes **HOW** the work will be done, **WHERE** the work will be done, and **who** will do the work.
