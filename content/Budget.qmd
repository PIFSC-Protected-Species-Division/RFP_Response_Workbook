## Overhead

-   Federal overhead changes annually based on the fiscal year. (See current rate [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NN2zkEjxZzIRA8-4dZUYk5gEhKZopVQLz7ZV3DuhL9w/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"})
-   Full overhead rate should be included in budget proposals to capture the complete cost to PIFSC, and Federal labor oversight for that project.
    -   Note that small boat costs are not included in the PIFSC overhead and need to be accounted for separately.
-   Contact Andrew Choy (andrew.choy\@noaa.gov) for federal labor rates to include overhead.

## Temporary funds

-   Contact Stephanie Garnett (stephanie.m.garnett\@noaa.gov) for all strategic procurement discussions.
-   Cooperative Institute (aka. CIMAR)
    -   New CIMAR grant projects require a minimum of \$100k
